#Credit Risk Classification Analysis
Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to create a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. Using historical data from a peer-to-peer lending services company, the model aims to predict whether a loan will be healthy or high-risk.
Technologies Used

Python 3
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NumPy
Pathlib

Process

Loaded and preprocessed lending data
Split data into training and testing sets
Created and trained a logistic regression model
Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix and classification reports

Results
The model achieved high accuracy in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans, with an overall accuracy of 99.2%. It showed particularly strong performance in identifying healthy loans (100% precision) while maintaining good accuracy for high-risk loans (84% precision).
